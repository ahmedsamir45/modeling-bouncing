        <h2>Euler's Method</h2>
        <p>Euler's method is a simple and first-order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It uses the following update equations:</p>
    
        <h2>Position Update Equation:</h2>
        <p>
            The update equation for the position (\(y\)) is:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            y_{n+1} = y_n + v_n \cdot \Delta t
            \]
            Where:
            - \(y_n\) is the current height (position),
            - \(v_n\) is the current velocity,
            - \(\Delta t\) is the time step.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Velocity Update Equation:</h2>
        <p>
            The update equation for the velocity (\(v\)) is:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            v_{n+1} = v_n - g \cdot \Delta t
            \]
            Where:
            - \(v_n\) is the current velocity,
            - \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)),
            - \(\Delta t\) is the time step.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):</h2>
        <p>
            The system we are solving involves the following ODEs for **position** and **velocity**:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            \frac{dy}{dt} = v(t)
            \]
            \[
            \frac{dv}{dt} = -g
            \]
            Where:
            - \(y(t)\) is the position of the object as a function of time,
            - \(v(t)\) is the velocity of the object as a function of time,
            - \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Kinetic Energy (KE):</h2>
        <p>
            The **kinetic energy** of the object can be calculated using the following equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
            \]
            Where:
            - \(m\) is the mass of the object,
            - \(v\) is the velocity of the object.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Coefficient of Restitution (Elastic Collision):</h2>
        <p>
            When the object hits the ground, the velocity is reversed and scaled by the **coefficient of restitution** (\(r\)), which determines how "bouncy" the object is:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[
            v_{n+1} = -r \cdot v_n
            \]
            Where:
            - \(v_n\) is the velocity just before the bounce,
            - \(r\) is the coefficient of restitution, which lies between 0 (no bounce) and 1 (perfect bounce).
        </p>
